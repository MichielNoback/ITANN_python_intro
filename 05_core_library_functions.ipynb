    "### Built-in functions\n",
    "These are the functions you have always at your disposal, without `import` statement. The list is not very long because this keeps the core of Python lean.\n",
    "The complete list can be found in the [doc page on built-ins](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The core contains \"constructor functions\" for all built-in datatypes - which we have already seen: `bool()`, `dict()`, `float()`, `int()`, `list()`, `set()`, `str()`, `tuple()` (some were not discussed and will neither be listed here)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also already discussed or demonstrated were `help()`, `input()`, `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, `range()`, `type()`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some functions related to object-oriented programming (OOP): `getattr()`, `setattr()`, `hasattr()`, `isinstance()`, `issubclass()`, `iter()`, `next()`, `staticmethod()` that will be deiscussed in the chapter on OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the listing below only a very short description is given. For a few others a more detailed discussion is provided in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `abs()` gives the absolute value of a number (i.e. removes the minus sign if present).\n",
    "- `dir()` and `vars()` help you inspect the attributes available on a class, object or the current environment.\n",
    "- `sum()` gives the sum of a numeric iterable.\n",
    "- `pow(a, b)` calculates power of a to b (a^4)\n",
    "- `round()` rounds a number to the given number decimal digits (or to the nearest integer of none provided)\n",
    "- `reversed()` gives a reversed _iterator_ of a sequence object. Can be inserted in a list or tuple constructor, or in a iteration control structure.\n"
