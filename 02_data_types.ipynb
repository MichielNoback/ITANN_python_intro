    "A scalar data type, or just **scalar**, is any non-collection value. Put differently, a scalar is a singular value. There are just a few different scalar values in Python to be found in the vast majority of Python code, and they are the same or at least similar across the vast majority of programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numeric types** represent numbers and they come in two flavours; with and without decimal part. \n",
    "    - integers have no decimal part (`int`) e.g. `2`, `3`, `140000000198`\n",
    "    - floating point numbers do have a decimal part (`float`) e.g. `3.211`, `2.0`, `5E-5`\n",
    "- **Text**: aka string data (`str`) e.g. `\"It's a wonderful world\"` or `'What a challenge!'`\n",

    "\n",
    "(I skipped binary and complex types for conciseness)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python is a weakly typed language you do not need to specify its type when creating a variable or literal. However, you can also get the type by using the `type()` function on any literal or variable. "

Being object-oriented means the (almost) everything is being modeled as an entity with data and behaviour (e.g. methods). Let's explore this concept with the string type. In Python, strings have only a single property - their character sequence. They do, however, have many methods. Both properties and methods are accessed on an object using the **dot operator**.
