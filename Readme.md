# A short Python intro

This repo contains a series of notebooks introducing programming concepts in Python in a data science setting.
You can view these notebooks on [NB viewer](https://nbviewer.org/) (fast, statically) or on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) (interactive, but much slower).

In NBviewer, simply paste the URL of this repository in the text field and select one of the notebooks, or paste the URL of a single notebook directly. In Binder it works the same. Enter the URL of this repo and press "launch"
